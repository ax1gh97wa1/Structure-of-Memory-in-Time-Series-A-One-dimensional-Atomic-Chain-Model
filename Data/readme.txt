/data
spectral data - Spectral data of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) series with different Hurst exponents, analyzed based on ARCH models, varying alpha1 parameters, and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSEC) data from different years, including full spectrum data, symmetric sub-spectrum data, and anti-symmetric sub-spectrum data.
